# Print human-readable form of an Integer.

Problem Statement:

Please write a program that accepts an integer as a command line argument, and
writes out a human-readable form of that integer following the format described
below. Here's an example set of inputs and outputs that you should see from
your program:

$ ./example-solution 1

one

$ ./example-solution 17

seventeen

$ ./example-solution 1000018

one million eighteen

$ ./example-solution 123456789

one hundred twenty three million four hundred fifty six thousand seven hundred eighty nine

You may make these assumptions:

- Your program will only be passed well-formed inputs.
- All of your inputs will be integers.
- All of your inputs will have an absolute value under 2 billion.
- You can write your code in any language you choose.
